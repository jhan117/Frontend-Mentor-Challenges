## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

When your image is one folder down as in the following structure:

html-project  
├── assets  
│        └── image.jpeg  
└── index.html  

Then you need to add the folder assets to the src attribute as follows:

```html
<img src="assets/image.jpeg" />
```

```css
.center
{
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

### Continued development

I will continue the easy projects. Because i need time to organize the knowledge i have learned so far.

### Useful resources

I like w3schools site... hahaha
