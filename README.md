## My process

**2022.02.08**
   
1. cards in card
   
Started : Use gird for RWD.
   
Completed : I designed it with a card in the card, but it was regrettable that I had no choice but to give it fixed values. So I think I need to study a little...

### What I learned

[**Pseudo-elements**](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_pseudo_elements.asp)   
#### What are Pseudo-Elements?
<ins>A CSS pseudo-element</ins> is used to style specified parts of an element.   
For example, it can be used to:
- Style the first letter, or line, of an element
- Insert content before, or after, the content of an element

1. The `::first-line` pseudo-element is used to add a special style to <ins>**the first line of a text.**</ins>
2. The `::first-letter` pseudo-element is used to add a special style to <ins>**the first letter of a text.**</ins>
3. The `::before` pseudo-element can be used to insert <ins>**some content before the content of an element.**</ins>
4. The `::after` pseudo-element can be used to insert <ins>**some content after the content of an element.**</ins>
5. The `::marker` pseudo-element selects <ins>**the markers of list items.**</ins>
6. The `::selection` pseudo-element matches <ins>**the portion of an element that is selected by a user.**</ins>
