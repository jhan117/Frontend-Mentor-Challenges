## My process

**2022.03.02**
   
1. main (include logo)
2. design box
3. footer (include logo)
   
Updated : Use max-width and position for RWD. and rebuilding code.
   
Completed: It was too difficult to the overlapping part.

### What I learned

[**CSS Syntax**](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_pos_z-index.asp)

```
z-index: auto|number|initial|inherit;
```

**Property Values**

| ----- | ----------- |
| auto | Sets the stack order equal to its parents. This is default
| number | Sets the stack order of the element. Negative numbers are allowed |
| initial | Sets this property to its default value. |
| inherit | Inherits this property from its parent element. |
   
[**Inline SVG**](https://css-tricks.com/change-color-of-svg-on-hover/)
In HTML
```HTML
<div>
  <svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
    <path d=""/>
  </svg>
</div>
```
In CSS
```CSS
svg:hover {
  fill: red;
}
```
